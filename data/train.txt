in IN O

that WDT O
when WRB O

to TO O
pull VB O

The DT O

next RB O
advised VBD O

to TO O
pluck VB O
up RP O
the DT O

the DT O
Owl NNP O

seeing VBG O

predicted VBD O

being VBG O

would MD O
contrive VB O

armed VBN O

themselves PRP O

The DT O
Birds NNS O
gave VBD O
no DT O

these DT O
warning NN O

considered VBD O
the DT O

to TO O

afterwards NNS O

finding VBG O

Hence NN O
it PRP O
is VBZ O
that IN O

they PRP O
look VBP O
